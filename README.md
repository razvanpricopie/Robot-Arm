# Robot-Arm

This is a simple Arduino project that I have created for a university course. 
The main purpose was the automation of one robotic arm that moves like a real arm. Another purpose was my fun :)

**The robot arm is controlled by a mobile application using the internet connexion**

## Components
The main component was one Arduino Uno board that load the program. For the internet connexion, I used an Ethernet Shield W5100.
Arm moving was realized by two servo motors, one for X-axis and one for Y-axis.
Other components: one breadboard, some wires, internet cable and power cable for board.
Other stuff: ice cream sticks for skeleton, cable tie, some glue and tape.

**I use RemoteXY platform for easy connection with Ethernet Shield**



In the first phase, I did the project by controlling with a joystick and I updated it for mobile.
Below I attached the wire diagram from the first phase.

I upload a presentation video in this repository.
I had fun making this project, I know that it doesn't have utilization.

I love Internet of Things!
